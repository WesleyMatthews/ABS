    <div class="jumbotron rounded-0 bg-transparent p-3 text-left">
      <h2 class="display-4">Education of students about health</h2>
      <p>All of the healthiest countries in the world have general diets that consist of lots of fruits and veggies, little sugar consumption, little fish and meat consumption, and rice. Part of childhood education would be educating students on how to eat healthy and why. It would be put in action in schools from community gardens, healthy and free school lunches to those who want it and healthy vending machines with no soda.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="jumbotron rounded-0 bg-light p-3 text-left">
      <h2 class="display-4">Education structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Every student is able to attend school cost-free to make sure that everyone is able to obtain an education.</li>
        <li>All schools in the city will be public in order to lessen the competition between schools to be the best and rather focus on teaching the students to the best of their ability. Also, there will be no private schools in order to make schools seem less like a business and to not let anyone get advantages just because of economic status.</li>
        <li>Our schools will focus on giving out quality homework that really helps to guide students on the right path about a subject and not so much on the quantity. The quantity will have to stay small in order to have more quality homework for students to do.</li>
        <li>In order to encourage students to keep up with the topic of the classroom, there will be no multiple-choice exams in our schools in order to make it harder for people to guess some answers and get it right. This is something that one of the countries, Finland, with the best school systems does.</li>
        <li>Our schools will work towards having students truly interested in the topic rather than focusing on them just regurgitating information the schools teach them. In order to do this we will focus a lot on interactive classroom activities that the students can work on as well as a learning environment in which the students collaborate in order to understand a topic fully.</li>
        <li>Our school system will work on having a good amount of breaks during school because it can become exhausting. Since we do encourage critical thinking there would be certain activities that will keep the students thinking during their breaks. Our school years will also not be year-round to make sure that students have plenty of time to pursue the topics they really enjoy.</li>
      </ul>
