      <h2 class="display-4">Clean energy</h2>
      <p>Geothermal energy is energy thatâ€™s harnessed from the earth's heart and produces little to no ghg emissions. We have many geothermal heat pumps which cycles water and geothermal energy through pipes underground. The pipes are not deep enough to o through bedrock and they are well insulated to prevent chemicals getting in the ground.</p>

      <h2 class="display-4">Biofuel</h2>
      <p>Around the world food waste contributes to about 8% of greenhouse gas emissions. To combat this, we turn food waste into biofuel which provides energy for transportation. This process happens by essentially pressure cooking food waste until it is turned into a bio-oil which can then be refined into biofuel. At the moment, this process is not completely carbon neutral but it has less of a carbon footprint than food waste does.</p>

      <h2 class="display-4">Public transportation</h2>
      <p>We have lots of funding towards public transportation to limit the number of cars on the streets. The public transportation options are available all throughout the city for free.</p>
