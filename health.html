      <h2 class="display-4">Healthcare</h2>
      <p>Every citizen automatically has free healthcare. Our research shows that nations with the best health have some form of universal health care. We do not have privatized healthcare so economic or employment status does not determine the quality of healthcare (Sen, 2015).</p>

      <h2 class="display-4">Electrospinning</h2>
      <p>The technology of 3-D printing has been harnessed and is being used constantly by our doctors. Originally, the technology was meant to be used to reduce the aftereffects of a transplant and ensure that the body reacted well to the new organ. This would reduce a lot of the complication that happened after the surgery. (Yasinski, 2020)</p><p>First, our researches focused on mainly the outer parts of the body which required less detailed mapping in order to make. The method used by our researchers was electrospinning which is still in use in our hospitals today. (Kelly, 2020)</p><p>In this method, the researches take a postage size sample of the patient and put it in a bioreactor to replicate the cell. Once enough cells have been replicated to make an outside part of the body, they move on to the next step. (Kelly, 2020)</p><p>The next step requires the doctors to make a scaffold of the part of the body that needs to be transplanted. This scaffold is normally built by spinning and layering similar to cotton candy, which serves as a matrix for the cells. Once the desired shape has been created by the electrospinner then the cells from the bioreactor are sprayed onto the matrix. (Kelly, 2020)</p><p>In order to ensure that the cells on the matrix properly, proper conditions and environment must be given to the matrix. So, the matrix is put into a warm environment copying a similar environment to a body. The matrix and the perfect environment allow the cells to activate in order to create the less important organs especially skin or blood vessels. (Kelly, 2020)</p>

      <h2 class="display-4">Organ Transplants</h2>
      <p>The organ transplant through 3D printing was first done by using a donor. However, recently we have upgraded to a more self sufficient way of making body organs. (Moxon, 2020)</p><p>Previously, the organ was built through the organ given by the donor. In this method, the organ was put in a similar machine to a washing machine till it was dried out, a process taking a few days. This returns only the skeleton of the organ which can be used as a matrix. Then, this matrix is populated with cells and serves as an organ that replaces the damaged organ. (Moxon, 2020)</p><p>However, our research teams decided to move one step further where they wanted to make an organ transplant without any donors. Their statement on the matter was, “We can’t depend on the life of one human to breathe life into another.” This statement pointed out the rarity of the donors who are willing to donate organs. (Moxon, 2020)</p><p>In order to tackle this problem, the research team took several steps to ensure the transplant went well. First, a series of ultrasounds and x-rays were taken to get the exact shape and size of the organ. This allowed for a more detailed picture to be created which was used for the better topography of the organs. They also made the machine more precise to ensure that there were no problems with the topography. This development allowed for the precise matrices to be created which helped create the organs that fit the body better shortening the chances of rejection. (Moxon, 2020)</p><p>Finally, our city has achieved the transplant of 3D printed organs and further research on the human brain is being conducted.</p>
